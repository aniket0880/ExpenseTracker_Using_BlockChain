# flutter_expense_manager_dapp

A Flutter-based Decentralized Application (DApp) for managing expenses using blockchain technology.

## Overview

This project is a **Flutter-based expense manager** that uses **Ethereum blockchain** to securely store and manage expense records. The app allows users to add and view expenses with transparency and immutability, ensuring that all data is stored on the blockchain through **Smart Contracts**.

This application leverages **Flutter** for the front-end, **Ganache** for the local Ethereum blockchain, and **Solidity** for writing the smart contract.

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter**: A UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
- **Ethereum Blockchain**: Provides a decentralized and secure method to store and track expenses.
- **Ganache**: A personal Ethereum blockchain for testing and deploying smart contracts locally.
- **Smart Contracts (Solidity)**: Smart contract written in Solidity to handle the logic of tracking and managing expenses.
- **Web3**: Used for connecting the Flutter app with the Ethereum blockchain.

## Features

- **Add Expenses**: Users can input expenses like amount, category, and description, and store them on the blockchain.
- **View Expenses**: Displays a list of all recorded expenses fetched from the blockchain.
- **Immutable & Transparent**: Data is stored securely on the blockchain and cannot be altered or deleted.
- **Blockchain Security**: Transactions and expense data are managed by Ethereum's decentralized network.
